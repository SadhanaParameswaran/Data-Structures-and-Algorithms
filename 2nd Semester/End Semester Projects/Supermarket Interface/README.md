This project aims to carry out the process of placing an online order ina supermarket for items and then calculating the bill for the itemsrequested with the help of Data structures.

This system is already used in many e-commerce websites to take the consumerâ€™s requirements, send it to the supplier and making both ends happy by mediating a suitable price.

This program also aims to do the same with the help of Data structures and can be easily modified to include more items.

19AIE111 - DATA STRUCTURES-1 – 2020 batch
Program List

1. Write a java program to read the text from “in.dat” file and copy the contents into another file by
replacing all ‘o’s or ‘0’s to *
2. Write a java program to read 10 numbers from “in.dat” file and sort them and store into another file.
3. Write a program to read the numbers from a file into two 2-dim arrays(matrices), find the sum,
rowsum, colsum, diagonalsum and print it with appropriate c aptions.
4. Display the upper triangular matrix and lower triangular matrix.
5. Display the frequency(count) of each number in the given matrix.
1 3 2
2 4 1
2 3 5
Count(1)=2 Count(2)=3 Count(3)=2 Count(4)=1 Count(5)=1

6. Challenging question: (OPTIONAL)
You have a matrix of size N * N with rows numbered through 1 to N from top to bottom and columns
through 1 to N from left to right. It contains all values from 1 to N2, i.e. each value from 1 to N2 occurs
exactly once in the matrix. Now, you start from the cell containing value 1, and from there visit the cell
with value 2, and then from there visit the cell with value 3, and so on till you have visited cell containing
the number N2. In a single step, you can move from a cell to one of its adjacent cells. Two cells are said
to be adjacent to each other if
they share an edge between them. Find out minimum number of steps required. (atleast number of
steps)
For example, if matrix is
1 3
2 4
You start from cell containing value 1 (i.e. (1,1)) and you want to visit cell with value 2 (i.e. (2,1)). Now, from
cell (2,1)
you have to visit cell (1,2), which can be done is 2 steps (First we go from (2, 1) to (1, 1) and then to (1, 2), total
2 steps).
Finally you move to cell where value 4 is present in 1 step. So, total number of steps required is 4.Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test
cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of matrix. Each of the next N lines
contain N integers denoting the values in the rows of the matrix.
Output
 For each test case, output in a single line the required answer.
Constraints
 1 ≤ T ≤ 5
 1 ≤ N ≤ 500
Subtasks
 Subtask 1 (30 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
 Subtask 2 (70 points) : Original constraints

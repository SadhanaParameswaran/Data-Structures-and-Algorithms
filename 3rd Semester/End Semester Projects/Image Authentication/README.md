Year after Year, the exponentially increasing crime occurs in the tech world either through direct funds theft like bitcoin/NFT/digital Art theft or through Spam DDoS-Attacks on sensitive sites from Bots.

This shows a method to convert a picture into a hash code using a hashing sequence similar to SHA256 where the image is converted to black and white then to binary then to a small unique hash value according to the algorithm designed by us.
This is the foundational algorithm and mechanism to how blockchain works
Image hashing is done for two reasons:
1.	Digital Art/NFT verification using image hashing
2.	New Captcha method to prevent Malicious Auto-Bots using picture check
